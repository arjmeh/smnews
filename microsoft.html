      <p>Microsoft announced that they might have to shut down their company
after <br>a huge stock market crash in Dow Jones. Microsoft stocks fell by
456.31% <br>and are currently at $0.34 per share. Microsoft is in serious danger and has <br>to act quick before it's too late. They seeked help from competitors like Apple,<br> to fund them, but Apple CEO Tim Cook, refused. Bill Gates even came back <br>to make sure that Microsoft wouldn't shut down. Hopefully Microsoft can get<br> back up, but many experts doubt a positive outcome.</p>
    <h2>"I hope we can escape this horrible experience and get back on track with the rest of the market soon." - Bill Gates</h2>
    <h2>"I didn't offer to help Microsoft after they betrayed us in 2017. I hope they can get back up but I doubt they will." - Tim Cook</h2>
