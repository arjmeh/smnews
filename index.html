    <h4 style="position: relative; left:550px; bottom: 30px">After Elon Musk cut Bill Gates in the McDonalds line, Bill Gates has <br>been attacking Elon Musk. He has almost been banned from Twitter for <br>bullying Elon Musk. On February 16 Elon Musk tweeted: "I have really <br>underestimated the power of Bill Gates and how much he can bully me." <br>Some controversy regarding whether McDonalds should be banned is also <br>going around. Thousands of protestors are dealing with this and trying to <br>close down McDonalds stores in Texas. 81 restaurants have already been <br>closed down. The Rock has also been included in this ordeal. He teased <br>Bill Gates after hearing Microsoft might close down. Bill Gates was so angry <br>that he bought a whole poster to stick onto the Microsoft office saying that <br>“the rock is bad”. Elon Musk even had to cancel his SpaceX rocket because <br>Tiktokers, who were Bill Gates fans, broke his rocket by throwing Microsoft <br>logos made of metal.</h4>

      According to an investigation at NYC police, the Rams were found guilty
      <br />for a false start on their touchdown. The score before the
      touchdown<br />
      was 16-20 Bengals ahead. The false start was not regarded when the
      <br />Rams scored the touchdown and is still being determined whether they
      <br />should have won.
