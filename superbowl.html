      Evidence shows that the Ram's actually didn't win Super Bowl 56. On
      February 13, 2022 Super Bowl 56 was played. In the last 2 minutes of the
      game, the Rams scored a touchdown. But there has been a lot of controversy
      regarding this touchdown. You see, they scored exactly 2 yards away from
      the touchdown line. But many don't realize that it was actually a false
      start and they didn't score. If this evidence is true, the Rams would have
      lost Super Bowl 56 by 4 points. This evidence was reported from the NYC
      police on February 14. Joe Burrow stated: "I was dissapointed when I
      realized that the Rams didn't score. We should have won and if it was a
      false start, I would have that ring on my hand."
